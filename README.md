# Amigaria

This repository contains a website developed as a team project, developed during the 2022 EOI Frontend development & Web design course. The team behind this project is the Lucid Lynx team, following the codename criteria stablished for this course structure.

Currently the repository hosts only the landing page of the project. In the near future, we will develop the main application, which will be built using the Vue3 framework.

## About the project

Our goal is to provide a platform from which people with disabilities and other social detriments may request company/assistance to other members of the community. The objective or mission behind the project is to stop the social exclusion of people using the web to enable their interactions with other people.

One of the main goals behind this project is providing a fully accesible website, as stablished by the WCAG 2.1 regulations and guidelines. This has been a key goal of the project from the very beggining, and it has been a fundamental part of our focus when designing the website.
